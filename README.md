# ChiliChat
ChiliChat is a simple messenger application with a command-line GUI, developed using pure Java and employing socket programming within a client/server architecture.

While primarily designed for local-host network usage, the program can be adapted for broader network functionality by modifying the IP address and port settings in the source code.

To run the program, follow these steps:

1. Open the 'Runnable' folder.
2. Start the server by executing the 'run.bat' file located in the 'server' folder.
3. Launch clients from the 'Sample Client' folder.
If you require additional client instances, you can duplicate the sample clients and run them concurrently.

Feel free to enjoy the capabilities of the ChiliChat!
